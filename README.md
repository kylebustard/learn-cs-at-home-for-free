#### What is this?

There are a few different use cases:

<details open>
<summary>Job interview prep</summary>
<br>  
  
#### Why?

- You want to pursue a new programming job, but... 

  - Your CS chops are rusty.
  
  - You have no CS chops.

<summary>A fun hobby.</summary>
<br>
  
#### Why?

- Computer Science is a field of applied mathematics.

  - Mathematics can help us solve everyday problems.
  
  - [Read this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-understand-advanced-mathematics-Does-it-feel-analogous-to-having-mastery-of-another-language-like-in-programming-or-linguistics) for an excellent summary on the benefits of higher math.

#### Why?

- You are a programmer, and you want the knowledge and skillset to make decisions based on tradeoff of designs and implementations.

## Design goals
The main goal is to build a plan that can be cover foundation concepts of data structures & algorithms. Additionally, the plan should be followed with just a 10-20 hour weekly committment.

This may not be a robust resource like [`code-interview-university`](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/README.md).

## Prereqs

Pick a language to master. _This is the language you will implement most of the algorithms with._

  <summary>Complete all of these tasks below in the language.</summary>

**This is a list I've borrowed from [here](http://blog.codingforinterviews.com/best-programming-language-jobs/)**

1. Initializing and using hash-backed maps (dictionaries) and sets
2. Performing queue and stack operations (whether using an array, like with Ruby’s pop/shift, or an explicit standard library implementation like Java’s Stack and Linked List-backed Queue classes)
3. Defining classes with constructors and attributes, static and instance methods, and defining a subclass and interface
4. Throwing exceptions for (1) invalid input and (2) custom messages
5. Iterating through arrays and dictionaries (both key and values)—including iterating while maintaining an index (Ruby’s each_with_index, Python’s enumerate)
6. Casting between strings and integers
7. Strings: get character at index, get range, concatenate
8. Initializing 2d arrays
9. Arithmetic: modulus (remainder), division (if the first operand is an integer, will it round the result to an integer?), rounding (ceiling and floor)
10. (Bonus) Switch statements
11. (Bonus) Built-in language sorting. Quickly defining a comparator to sort an array.
12. (More advanced candidates) The 5 standard bit manipulation operations (L/R shifts, not, or, and, xor)

## Week 1

Implement a **linked list.**

Describe space/time analysis of a linked list.
