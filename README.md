# Preface
## What is this?
There are a few different use cases:

<details>
<summary>Job interview prep</summary><br>

- You want to pursue a new programming job, but... 
  - Your CS chops are rusty.
  - You have no CS chops.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Advancing your skills and career.</summary><br>
  
- You are a programmer, and you want the knowledge and skillset to make decisions based on tradeoffs of design and implementation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solace from <i><code>rapidly changing technology</code></i> fatigue.</summary><br> 
  
- _JavaScript fatigue_ may be alleviated in an individual programmer by their continued improvement and understanding of fundamentals. 
  - Vanilla JavaScript–because any new library or framework is built on vanilla JavaScript. 
  - **Computer Science!** Because computer science knowledge translates across all programming languages. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>A fun hobby.</summary><br>

- Computer Science is a field of applied mathematics.
  - Mathematics can help us solve everyday problems.
  - [Read this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-understand-advanced-mathematics-Does-it-feel-analogous-to-having-mastery-of-another-language-like-in-programming-or-linguistics) for an excellent summary on the benefits of higher math.
</details>

## Design goals
Implement a plan that to learn and practice foundational concepts of data structures & algorithms. Additionally, the plan should be followed with just a 10-20 hour weekly committment.

This may not be a robust resource like [`code-interview-university`](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/README.md), rather a more light-weight but actionable plan.

# Prerequisite
If this section cannot be achieved with existing programming skills, this will be preliminary work before moving on.

Pick a language to master.
_This is the language you will implement most of the algorithms with._

<details>
<summary>Complete all of these tasks below in the language.</summary><br>

1. Initializing and using hash-backed maps (dictionaries) and sets
2. Performing queue and stack operations (whether using an array, like with Ruby’s pop/shift, or an explicit standard library implementation like Java’s Stack and Linked List-backed Queue classes)
3. Defining classes with constructors and attributes, static and instance methods, and defining a subclass and interface
4. Throwing exceptions for (1) invalid input and (2) custom messages
5. Iterating through arrays and dictionaries (both key and values)—including iterating while maintaining an index (Ruby’s each_with_index, Python’s enumerate)
6. Casting between strings and integers
7. Strings: get character at index, get range, concatenate
8. Initializing 2d arrays
9. Arithmetic: modulus (remainder), division (if the first operand is an integer, will it round the result to an integer?), rounding (ceiling and floor)
10. (Bonus) Switch statements
11. (Bonus) Built-in language sorting. Quickly defining a comparator to sort an array.
12. (More advanced candidates) The 5 standard bit manipulation operations (L/R shifts, not, or, and, xor)

The above list I've borrowed from [here](http://blog.codingforinterviews.com/best-programming-language-jobs/).
